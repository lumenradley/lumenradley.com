This is my corner of the internet.

I write about software, ideas, and whatever I'm building at the time. Posts live here as plain Markdown files, syndicated to a newsletter for anyone who prefers email, and eventually accompanied by a podcast.

The site is intentionally simple: static HTML, no tracking, no pop-ups, no sign-up walls. If you want to follow along, grab the [RSS feed](/rss.xml) or subscribe to the [newsletter](https://lumenradley.substack.com).

More soon.
